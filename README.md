## Phase 1: Admin Foundation & Quiz Creation üèóÔ∏è
This phase is about giving the admin all the tools they need to create and manage quiz content.

Goal: An admin can log in, manage quiz templates, add/edit questions, and configure all quiz settings.

Key Features:

Full admin authentication (Login, Logout, Protected Routes).

A dashboard to view, create, and delete quiz templates.

A comprehensive quiz editor page.

Functionality to add, edit, and delete questions for a quiz.

A form to configure all settings (timers, shuffling, etc.) with our logical rules.

Hardest Part & Our Demo: The most complex piece is the quiz editor's state management.

Demo: We will first build the AddQuestionsPage.jsx to correctly save a quiz's title and its settings to the database, ensuring all the conflicting options (like disabling shuffling when admin-paced is on) work perfectly in the UI.

## Phase 2: Live Session Management & Student Join üö™
This phase focuses on making a quiz "live" and allowing students to enter the waiting room.

Goal: An admin can control the state of a quiz (Deploy, Start, Stop), and students can join a deployed quiz.

Key Features:

Functional "Deploy," "Start," "Stop," and "Reset" buttons on the admin dashboard.

A homepage where students enter a join code.

A pre-quiz instruction screen (the lobby) where students enter their name and wait.

A live view for the admin to see which players have joined the lobby.

Hardest Part & Our Demo: The real-time lobby sync.

Demo: We'll create a simple view for the admin that shows a list of players. We will test to ensure that when a new student joins, their name instantly appears on the admin's screen using Supabase's Realtime Broadcast.

## Phase 3: The Live Gameplay Loop üéÆ
This is the core, interactive part of the quiz for the student.

Goal: An admin can push questions to players, and players can see them in real-time.

Key Features:

When the admin starts the quiz, students are moved from the lobby to the first question.

The PlayQuizPage will display the current question and options.

An admin-controlled "Next Question" button that updates the screen for all players simultaneously.

Logic for timers (both per-question and overall) that correctly locks answers when time is up.

Hardest Part & Our Demo: Synchronizing the game state.

Demo: We will use a Supabase Edge Function as our central "game engine." The demo will have the admin click a "Next" button, which calls the function. The function will then broadcast the new question index to all connected players, proving our core real-time gameplay loop works.

## Phase 4: Scoring & Results üèÜ
This phase completes the quiz by handling answers and showing the final results.

Goal: Student answers are submitted and scored securely, with a final leaderboard.

Key Features:

When a student clicks an answer, it's sent to an Edge Function.

The Edge Function validates the answer against the correct one in the database.

The student receives immediate feedback ("Correct" or "Incorrect").

Scores are updated in the database.

When the quiz ends, a final results page shows a ranked leaderboard.

Hardest Part & Our Demo: Secure, server-side answer validation.

Demo: We will create an Edge Function that receives a questionId and a submittedAnswer. The function will look up the correct answer in the database, compare them, and return true or false. This proves our scoring is secure and cheat-proof.

## Phase 5: UI/UX Polish ‚ú®
Once everything is functional, we will make it look great.

Goal: Refine the user interface to be attractive, smooth, and professional.

Key Features:

Implement the glassmorphism design across the application.

Add the connection status indicator.

Ensure the entire application is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

Add smooth transitions and loading animations.

Hardest Part & Our Demo: Implementing the glassmorphism UI with CSS.

Demo: We'll create a single, reusable React component (like a "Card") that perfectly captures the glassmorphism style, and then apply it throughout the app.
